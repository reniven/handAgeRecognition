# What it is?

  * A bone age study helps doctors estimate the maturity of a child's skeletal system


# why it is done?

  * The bone age study can help evaluate how fast or slowly a child's skeleton is maturing, which can help doctors diagnose conditions that delay or accelerate physical growth and development.
  * Bone age can be used to predict :
      - Age.
      - How much time a child will be growing
      - when a child enter puberty
      - The child ultimate height

# focus group
  * age 13 - 18, because By the age of 18 years, bone age cannot be computed from hand & wrist radiographs, therefore the medial end of the clavicle is used for bone age calculation

# Why should you use this website? & problem out there.
  * According to health.costhelper.com, X-rays typically cost about $100-$1,000 or more plus doctor fee, so using the website will help reduce the cost.
  * For Doctor, this website can save time and money and effort.
  * Data would be more consistence. Doctors can predict differently.
